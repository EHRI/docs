EHRI Digital Editions - Documentation
=====================================

A key goal of the EHRI online editions platform is to develop annotated
online editions of documents as a new way of presenting digital archival
content. The editions are facilitated by new EHRI tools for digital
editing and use and improve upon the EHRI vocabularies and descriptions
to generate contextual information displayed to users.

Compared to analogue editions, the freely accessible online editions
enable new research approaches and a different reading of the documents.
Through metadata-tagging and geo-referencing, the editions do not
exclusively follow thematic or chronological patterns; they are
searchable and filtered for specific thematic or spatial interests at
any time and are contextualised through interactive maps. EHRI platform
hopes to support and possibly host third party projects.
