Groups
======

Groups in the EHRI portal admin provide a way to give users *role-based* permissions. Permissions granted to a group
will be inherited by all users who belong to it. Groups can also belong to other groups, so access to certain
functionality can be tiered.

Creating Groups
===============

Groups can only be created by EHRI super-users (those belonging to the **admin** group.) Super-users will have the
option to create new groups on the right-hand-size of the groups page:
