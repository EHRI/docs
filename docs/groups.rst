Groups
======

Groups in the EHRI portal admin provide a way to give users *role-based* permissions. Permissions granted to a group
will be inherited by all users who belong to it. Groups can also belong to other groups, so access to certain
functionality can be tiered.

Groups can only be created by EHRI super-users (those belonging to the **admin** group.
