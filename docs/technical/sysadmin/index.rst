EHRI System Administration
==========================

These documents describe the current state of system administration for the EHRI sites as of February 2018.

Hosting
-------

EHRI uses cloud VPS systems provided by `Digital Ocean <http://digitalocean.com>`_, primarily because DO provide servers
based in the Netherlands, which was a requirement for EHRI data. 

DO provide team administration for servers, so if your require access ask to be added to the EHRI team.
