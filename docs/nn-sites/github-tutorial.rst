Setting up a new NN page on Github
==================================

Create a Github account if you don't have one already:

    https://github.com/join
    
Visit the repository on Github:

    https://github.com/EHRI/ehri-nn-hugo-template
    
Go to "Fork" near the title and select "Create a new fork"

Select yourself as the "Owner" and put something like "ehri-gb-test" as the repository name.

Provide an optional description if you wish.

Locate your new "Fork" at https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY

Go to "Settings"

On the left hand side, select "Pages"

Under "Build and Deployment" select "Github Actions".

Now, on the top of the page, select "Actions".

On the left, click "Deploy Hugo site to Pages".

On the action, select "Run workflow".

It will say "Queued"
