Adapting the National Node template site
========================================

The following instructions are designed for the EHRI National Coordinators and National Consortia which build and
administer the EHRI national websites which inform about the services and activities in the respective countries
as well as trans-nationally. These websites will provide content in national language(s) and - where relevant - in English.

Developing web sites, especially multi-lingual ones, can be a **complicated business** and there are many ways to go about it.
For example, you could use a WYSIWYG site builder like Squarespace or Wix, a CMS like Wordpress or Drupal, or even write
a site by hand using HTML and CSS. In order to offer a straightforward option to get started we have created a template site that can
be used as a placeholder until a permanent solution is found, or adapted to the specific needs of different EHRI National Nodes. This
template makes use of a static site generator called `Hugo <https://gohugo.io>`_ which is highly customisable, supports multiple languages, and
is fast and straightforward to deploy.

.. warning:: Building a Hugo site requires some knowledge of tools like Git/Github, programming text editors, Markdown,
          and web technologies. If you are not confident with this, using a WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get)
          website builder tool like Squarespace is **strongly recommended**.

Two tutorials are offered below. The first is a step-by-step guide to setting up a Hugo site using the EHRI template, and the second
is a guide to creating a site using _only_ the Github web interface. The latter is less flexible but requires no local setup,
and is therefore a good option for those who are not comfortable with the command line.
