Accessing the Portal Administration pages
=========================================

Access to the Portal Administration pages must be granted by an existing EHRI administrator by pre-arrangement.
If you have arranged to become an administrator, first `sign up <https://portal.ehri-project.eu/login#register>`_ to
the portal, making sure to verify your email address by clicking the link in the confirmation e-mail you'll be sent
(check your spam box if it doesn't seem to arrive.) Then let the EHRI admin know the name of your account.

Once they have checked your account and enable staff access you should see a link to the
`admin pages <https://portal.ehri-project.eu/admin>`_ at the top of the portal website.
