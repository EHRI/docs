How to create Connections between Originals and Copies
******************************************************

In the EHRI Portal we can create links between the archival institutions
which hold the original archival units and the archival institutions
which hold copies of the original archival unit.

Four types of connections between copies and originals can be created:

-  Original archival unit – Copy archival unit;
-  Original archival institution – Copy archival institution;
-  Original archival institution – Copy archival unit;
-  Original archival unit – Copy archival institution.

Before you start creating connections, please make sure you are working
in your Admin profile. A good idea would be to review the information
and tips & tricks described earlier.

For our first type of connection we will work on linking an original
archival unit held in Warsaw, Poland with a copy collection held in
Vilnius, Lithuania.

Once you have identified the copy archival unit you want to connect, go
to Actions > Link to another item.
