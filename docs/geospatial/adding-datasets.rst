How to contribute data
=======================
Even though EHRI creates some datasets of its own, it relies on the research community to contribute. The Geospatial Repository serves as a repository for data developed by projects, institutions and individual researchers. We are interested in collecting and storing all kinds of spatial data useful for Holocaust-related research.
We require contributors to submit a minimum of standardised metadata describing the dataset. This will facilitate discovery and provide users with a understanding of the (often complex) data.
The datasets can be uploaded and saved in a variety of formats (such as shapefiles, CSV, GeoTIFF, etc.). EHRIâ€™s staff will check the data, standardise it if needed and internally store it as a GeoPackage. In a next step, the dataset will be pushed into the EHRI Geoserver (providing standardised services such as WMS, WFS, etc.) and linked to the Geospatial Repository which serves as a metadata store.
Please refer to the documentation and provide information about the data via this form. The EHRI staff will be happy to assist you in the process of uploading and describing datasets.
