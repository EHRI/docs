Adding datasets
***************

The repository has two components:

 - an instance of `GeoServer <https://geoserver.org/>`_ that stores geospatial data and makes it available via a range of OGC APIs
 - an  instance of `Geonetwork <https://geonetwork-opensource.org>`_ that provides metadata cataloguing, browsing and discovery functionality

A dataset typically consists of some vector (or raster) data contained in a `GeoPackage <https://www.geopackage.org/>`_
that is ingested into the GeoServer instance and then catalogued in Geonetwork.
