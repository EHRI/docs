How to contribute data
=======================
Even though EHRI creates some `datasets of its own <https://geodata.ehri-project-test.eu/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search?isTemplate=n&resourceTemporalDateRange=%7B%22range%22:%7B%22resourceTemporalDateRange%22:%7B%22gte%22:null,%22lte%22:null,%22relation%22:%22intersects%22%7D%7D%7D&sortBy=relevance&from=1&to=30&languageStrategy=searchInAllLanguages&query_string=%7B%22OrgForResource%22:%7B%22European%20Holocaust%20Research%20Infrastructure%22:true%7D%7D>`_, it relies on the research community to contribute. The Geospatial Repository serves as a repository for data developed by projects, institutions and individual researchers. We are interested in collecting and storing all kinds of spatial data useful for Holocaust-related research.

We require contributors to submit a minimum of standardised metadata describing the dataset. This will facilitate discovery and provide users with a understanding of the (often complex) data.

The datasets can be uploaded and saved in a variety of formats (such as shapefiles, CSV, GeoTIFF, etc.). EHRIâ€™s staff will check the data, standardise it if needed and internally store it as a `GeoPackage <https://www.geopackage.org/>`_. In a next step, the dataset will be pushed into the EHRI Geoserver (providing standardised services such as `WMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service>`_, `WFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service>`_, etc.) and linked to the Geospatial Repository which serves as a metadata store.
Please refer to the documentation and provide information about the data via `this form <https://forms.office.com/e/gQwcmbswVe>`_. The EHRI staff will be happy to assist you in the process of uploading and describing datasets.
