Introduction
=============
The Geospatial Repository was developed within the EHRI-3 project in response to user requirements which we identified: our survey and focus groups indicated a strong need for a better access to standardised geospatial information. It showed that researchers, projects and institutions struggle in getting access to historical data making it possible to build maps, enrich datasets with place information and more.

The EHRI Geospatial Repository offers researchers, projects and organisations to
  - store and share geodata in a standard compliant, reusable way
  - search and explore datasets based on their metadata
  - use, download and combine datasets for mapping, data enrichment or spatial analysis

We also aim to avoid duplicating efforts when different institutions or projects gather similar types of spatial information, for instance, when cataloging archival collections or tracking the movements of Holocaust victims.
