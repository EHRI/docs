Contribute to the EHRI Document Blog
=====================================
EHRI provides a space to discuss and present datasets in detail via the `EHRI Document Blog <https://blog.ehri-project.eu/>`_ which is specifically designed to share ideas about Holocaust-related archival documentation, its presentation and interpretation using digital tools. We encourage contributors and users of the Geospatial Repository to share their knowledge and experience, maps and scripts (including Jupyter notebooks and similar) in the Blog. The `blog is open <https://blog.ehri-project.eu/about/contribute/>`_ to contributions reflecting on your experience with geospatial data as well.

In the near future, we plan to enhance the usage of the Geospatial Repository by different forms of training. To stay informed, we recommend subscribing to the EHRI newsletter (https://www.ehri-project.eu/ehri-newsletter).
