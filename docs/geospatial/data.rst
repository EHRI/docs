What data is collected?
========================
The Geospatial Repository aims to provide access to any geospatial data which can be relevant for the research about the Holocaust. This includes, but is not limited to the EHRI taxonomy used for cataloguing data in Holocaust Geographies which is developed `here <https://github.com/michalfrankl/ehri-holocaust-geographies>`_. Examples include historical borders, places of persecution such as ghettos and camps, data related to local history of the Holocaust and to history of refugees during the Holocaust or sites of remembrance.
The data can be provided both in vector data (consisting of points, lines and polygons) and raster data (made up of pixels; images).
